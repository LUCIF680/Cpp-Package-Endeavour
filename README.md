#Missions
As C++ grows old it need to be updated in a morden way.<br>
## Having data types as less as possible
  *String<br>
  *Int<br>
  *Double<br>
## Multiple datatype array
STL sure contains list,map,vector but still C++ is lacking multiple datatype array. So here it is,<br>
~~~
Array y = {50,70,"ram"};
String x = y.getValue<String>(2); // x now contains "ram"
x.debug(); // Will output "ram"
~~~
Double and float are yet to be added.
